# GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) shaders

- Vertex Shader (vshader): Responsible for moving each vertex into place - handles the geometry and positioning of vertices in 3D space

- Fragment Shader (fshader): Responsible for setting the color for each pixel - determines the final color output for each pixel on the screen
