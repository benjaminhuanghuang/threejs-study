# Ch 2: The Basic Components That Make Up A Three.Js Application

- Camera: This determines which part of THREE.Scene is rendered onscreen.

- Lights: These have an effect on how materials are shown and are used when creating shadow effects (discussed in detail in Chapter 3, Working with Light Sources in Three.js).

- Meshes: These are the main objects that are rendered from the perspective of the camera. These objects contain the vertices and faces that make up the geometry (for example, a sphere or a cube) and contain a material, which defines what the geometry looks like.

- Renderer: This uses the camera and the information in the scene to draw (render) the output on the screen.
