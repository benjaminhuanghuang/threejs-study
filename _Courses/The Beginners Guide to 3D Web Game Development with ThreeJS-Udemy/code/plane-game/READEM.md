GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) shaders:

- Vertex Shader (vshader): Responsible for moving each vertex into place - handles the geometry and positioning of vertices in 3D space

- Fragment Shader (fshader): Responsible for setting the color for each pixel - determines the final color output for each pixel on the screen

### Lifetime of an explosion

Collision -> New explosion -> Tween -> Update called in loop -> onComplete() called -> Remove explosion from array
